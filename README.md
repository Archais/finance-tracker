# Finance Tracker

Finance Tracker is a GUI personal finance tracker that was built with the PyQt5 framework (the non-commercial version), and it uses a SQLite database to store data.

This project started as my CS50x 2020 final project, however I do intend to maintain and improve it.

# Getting Started

The steps to get started are:
* Copy entire project to the directory that you would like to run it from
* The "setup.py" will need to be run- this will install PyQt5 and any other dependencies as well as create the database
* ...and you're done, just run "finance.py" to use this program
